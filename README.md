*Display a histogram of the frequency of words in "Alice in Wonderland" text*


### Data Analysis with mapReduce
Let's create a histogram of the frequency of words in an extract from Alice in Wonderland. We want to know how often each word appears.

This is a typical use case for mapReduce.

Plan:

- tokenize the text
- clear of rare symbols
- remove stop words
- normalize rendering
- calculate the histogram
- normalize the histogram
- print it out
